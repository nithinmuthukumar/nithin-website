## Accumulated Knowledge

Against Dimir, sequencing around <CardName>Floodpits Drowner</CardName> is critical. Avoid playing <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> into open mana when possible - if they stun the animated land, it's essentially a timewalk. Using Cub on <CardName>Fabled Passage</CardName> is a safer line since you get guaranteed value even if they have interaction. Hand disruption is key in this matchup since it reveals what to play around and can snipe <CardName>Enduring Curiosity</CardName> before it sticks.



## Reflections From Last Week

This week I published the [Golgari Airship Deck Guide](/decks/golgari-airship). Writing it out forced me to articulate a lot of the things I'd been doing on autopilot, and I found gaps in my reasoning for certain matchups. The sideboard guide section was especially useful - having concrete in/out plans rather than vibing each game has made my sideboarding more consistent.

I also experienced some pretty wild variance this week. Had a 12 game winstreak that felt like I couldn't lose, then immediately followed by a loss streak that made me question everything. These streaks can really distort how you perceive the deck. During the winstreak, every card felt amazing and every decision felt correct. During the loss streak, I started second-guessing card choices and lines that were probably fine. It's easy to attribute wins to skill and losses to bad draws, or vice versa. The reality is that sample size matters - you need enough games to separate signal from noise. This is why I'm tracking data on Untapped rather than just going off feel.
