##  Introduction
With the release of the Avatar set, I've spent the past week brewing and refining a <CardName>Phoenix Fleet Airship</CardName> deck. The set has been a fantastic addition to Standard, with a lot of powerful tools.

This write-up is meant to give an overview of the deck’s core game plan rather than a full sideboard guide. I’m still testing different configurations, and the metagame is still settling.

##  Overview  
This is a grindy midrange deck built around <CardName>Phoenix Fleet Airship</CardName> as an extremely resilient, inevitable top-end. The primary plan is to land an Airship early and start triggering the sacrifice clause every turn, turning it into a scaling engine most decks can't keep up with.

Airship is an extremely versatile card. It can play the aggressive role when ahead, crewing up and pushing damage, but it also shines in grindy games where you're happy to trade on defense. Whenever your opponent spends removal or trades a creature into an Airship, it's card advantage since they lost something while the Airships continue to grow every turn. The tricky part is knowing when to trade and when to sit back — sometimes pushing damage matters, but letting your Airship count grow exponentially is also a line, especially when your opponent can't remove them efficiently.

The deck can also just play a fair game plan using <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> as an engine and <CardName>Sentinel of the Nameless City</CardName> as the primary threat. Growing your creatures and giving them lifelink is very strong in creature based matchups.

##  Card Breakdown

### Ramp Creatures

- 4 x <CardName>Llanowar Elves</CardName>

- 3 x <CardName>Gene Pollinator</CardName>

- 4 x <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName>

The ramp in this deck serves 2 purposes. The first is getting down Airship and having extra mana to sacrifice artifact tokens. The second is to have bodies to crew the Airships.

Airship having a crew cost of 1 makes these creatures really important for utilizing them in combat.


<CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> is an absurdly strong card. With mana dorks it produces huge bursts of mana, and it is one of the biggest reasons to run the ramp package in the first place. It effectively doubles your mana, which can let the deck explode out the gates.

### Other Creatures
- 1 x <CardName>Umbral Collar Zealot</CardName>

Being a free sacrifice outlet makes it much easier to enable Airship, and it also helps you reach three sacrifices in a turn for the lifelink trigger on <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName>. It can also serve as sweeper protection by reducing the Airship count to below 8 so you can freely go for the 8 Airships and make your opponent have it. The surveil is also nice to dig for whatever you need.

- 4 x <CardName>Sentinel of the Nameless City</CardName>

The enter and attack triggers that create map tokens are very synergistic with the deck, since they are easy to sacrifice. Sentinel having vigilance also makes it strong on both offense and defense, so it's an ideal body to stack counters on.

- 3 x <CardName>Pawpatch Recruit</CardName>

Pawpatch is primarily a card that punishes spot removal, which is good in matchups like dimir or izzet. Specifically for this deck, Airships need bodies to be effective so it's really nice to have the option to offspring for more bodies. The token is also beseech fodder.

Other Options: <CardName>Tough Cookie</CardName>


### Card Advantage

- 4 x <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName>

I have been extremely impressed with this card. It provides real card advantage, especially when you ramp and have the extra mana to use it effectively. It always gives you a token to sacrifice, which is very important for enabling Airship. The counters and lifelink are also strong for the beatdown plan, especially in creature matchups where you want to outsize blockers. Sentinel needs to attack to trigger, so making it harder to block is a big deal. The lifelink helps stabilize the board, and against aggro it is often game winning to set up one large lifelink attack.

### Removal 
The removal suite is fairly light, I find it hard to trade 1 for 1 with other creature decks in the format. Black removal isn't as good as it was, but either way should be tuned to reflect the threats in the meta. 

- 4 x <CardName>Tragic Trajectory</CardName>

This deck's primary game plan involves making and sacrificing permanents which triggers void easily. It's also really cheap.
- 2 x <CardName>Day of Black Sun</CardName>

There is no better board wipe in black for this deck. I would really love a 4 mv sweeper to tutor off of beseech, in black but the only option is <CardName>Terror Tide</CardName> which this deck can't support. Day of Black Sun atleast destroys tokens when cast this way. 

Aside from that it's really effective against the green aggro decks, most of their threats have low cmc and it kills <CardName>Tyvar, The Pummeler</CardName>. 

Other Options: <CardName>The Witch's Vanity</CardName>, <CardName> Nowhere to Run </CardName>, <CardName> Momentum Breaker </CardName> 

### Top-End

- 3 x <CardName>Phoenix Fleet Airship</CardName> 

Why only three copies of the namesake card?

Airship is at its best when cast off <CardName>Beseech The Mirror</CardName>, since that immediately satisfies the sacrifice condition and starts the replication right away. Casting Airship on turn four with no way to trigger it is far less impactful.

Redundant copies also provide minimal benefit. Because the replication scales exponentially, additional Airships don't meaningfully accelerate reaching the eight-Airship threshold — eight is a power of two, so the growth pattern (1 → 2 → 4 → 8) means the deck doesn't gain much from drawing extras. The focus is on reliably triggering replication, not playing multiple copies.
 
- 4 x <CardName>Beseech The Mirror</CardName>

As mentioned above, <CardName>Beseech The Mirror</CardName> is the perfect card to pair with Airship. It's also able to tutor for post-sideboard hate pieces and boardwipes.

Other Options: <CardName>Ouroboroid</CardName>, <CardName>Elegy Acolyte</CardName>


## Mana Base  
50% of cards are green
37% of symbols are green

50% of cards are black
63% of symbols are black

The mana is not ideal because Golgari does not have access to a shockland. This deck also wants to avoid playing too many taplands, since they mess with the curve, especially if you draw multiples. The mana base doesn't really have space for utilty even though they would be really nice, since beseech has such an intensive cost.

- 1 x Forest
- 5 x Swamp

The deck needs a high black count to reliably cast <CardName>Beseech The Mirror</CardName>. Beseech is very color intensive, so having enough black sources is essential. <CardName>Wastewood Verge</CardName> being green first helps a lot here since it plays like a Forest in the early game, which makes it easy to develop your mana dorks, while still giving you black later so you can cast Beseech on time.

- 4 x <CardName>Blooming Marsh</CardName>
- 4 x <CardName>Wastewood Verge</CardName>
- 4 x <CardName>Multiversal Passage</CardName> 

The substitute shockland, super important to help make verges tap for black.
- 2 x <CardName>Restless Cottage</CardName>

<CardName>Restless Cottage</CardName> is a very synergistic manland in this deck since it's able to generate sac fodder. Manlands are also just really good with <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> since they animate it for free. Only 2 copies are played because it enters tapped.

- 2 x <CardName>Starting Town</CardName> 

Also another multicolor card, playing limited copies because it enters tapped on turn 4, which can be another bottleneck especially if your creatures are removed.

- 2 x <CardName>Fabled Passage</CardName>

Enters tapped early which isn't ideal for curving out but it has upsides that are worth it. Counts as a sacrifice trigger for Airship, enables playing Airship and immediately triggering it without extra mana.
Also helps get the third sacrifice for pursuit.

## Sideboard Cards 
- 3 x <CardName>Duress</CardName>

<CardName>Duress</CardName> is very important in control matchups. It lets you snipe the opponent's answers and counterspells before they matter. Removing their key interaction makes your gameplan much harder to stop.

- 3 x <CardName>Intimidation Tactics</CardName>

<CardName>Intimidation Tactics</CardName> is very strong at removing creatures with a strong effect from the opponent's hand before they can have an impact through an etb or combo. This deck is low on instant speed removal so a few copies is nice to deal with payoffs in any creature matchup.

- 1 x <CardName>Day of Judgment</CardName>

Black currently lacks a strong four-mana sweeper in Standard, so the deck splashes white for <CardName>Day of Judgment</CardName>. Having access to this effect through <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> provides a reliable way to reset the board. In creature matchups especially, value engines like <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> and the Airship plan gain a huge advantage when the board is wiped on favorable terms.

You do not want to draw or see it in your opening hand, as it’s extremely difficult to cast. However, it is technically castable with help from cards like Gene Pollinator, Starting Towns, and Multiversal Passage.

- 2 x <CardName>Heritage Reclamation</CardName>

Hits enchantments and artifacts while also offering some secondary graveyard disruption. Its flexibility makes it useful across multiple matchups.

- 2 x <CardName>Raven Eagle</CardName>

Provides graveyard hate with a token creation effect. It's not reliable enough to play maindeck when the exile trigger isn't relevant but it's a solid option as graveyard hate. 

- 2 x <CardName>Torpor Orb</CardName>

This card lines up well against several decks in the format. Allies, Airbending Combo, and Spider-Man Combo all rely heavily on ETBs and are often completely shut down when it’s in play. It does incidentally affect a few ETB effects in this deck, such as Badgermole Cub and Sentinel, but the impact is minimal compared to how much it disrupts opposing strategies.

- 1 x <CardName>Bitter Triumph</CardName>

Extra removal for creatures or planeswalkers

Other Options: <CardName>For the Common Good</CardName>, <CardName>Ruinous Bloodbending</CardName>, <CardName>Keen-Eyed Curator</CardName>, <CardName>Soul-Guide Lantern</CardName>

## Curve 

<CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> is what pushes the deck toward playing many two mana cards, because it allows you to cast an additional spell on turn 2. 

Elf decks usually want to curve into a three mana play, but <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> enables an entirely new pattern. The ideal start becomes mana dork into Cub with another two mana spell on turn 2. <CardName>Gene Pollinator</CardName> supports this line as well and gives the deck redundancy.

An ideal curve looks like this:
T1: <CardName>Llanowar Elves</CardName> or <CardName>Gene Pollinator</CardName>
T2: <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> and <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName>
T3: Untap with 6 mana <CardName>Beseech The Mirror</CardName> for Airship + 2 drop/Crack a Clue.

## Airship Combat

Airships are very strong on both offense and defense. On defense you will almost always be able to block, because the Airships can crew each other in response to removal. This makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to push through the final points of damage once the Airships start multiplying.

### Eight Copy Threshold
8 Airships in non-control matchups is usually game winning. Even if the opponent has removal on their turn, it doesn't leave you defenseless since Airships can still crew each other in response.

On offense it is important not to attack with every Airship once you reach the threshold if you think the opponent has removal. If the opponent removes one during combat, the rest will stop being creatures and you can lose the entire attack. Leaving a few creatures or Airships untapped gives you the ability to crew in response to removal and protects your combat step.

## Playing Against Sweepers

One of my initial concerns against control was that once you reach the threshold, your Airships become vulnerable to sweepers that can wipe out everything you have built. The main way to navigate this is through play patterns. You want to force the control player to spend spot removal on Airships, which still works out in your favor because they are trading real resources into something that replaces itself. 

Another important trick is to avoid sacrificing on your own turn if you suspect they are holding a sweeper. By staying below the threshold, you keep your Airships safe while still presenting a threat, since they will take over the game as long as you have creatures to crew. <CardName>Umbral Collar Zealot</CardName> also functions as sweeper protection, because you can sacrifice Airships at any time to drop back under the threshold.

The other major concern is <CardName>Ultima</CardName>. It can be devastating in the wrong spot, but most lists only play a single copy, and many prefer <CardName>Day of Judgment</CardName> or skip Ultima entirely in the current meta. The best way to fight sweepers is to maintain steady pressure so the opponent is forced to use them early and for less value. After sideboarding, <CardName>Duress</CardName> helps by sniping a sweeper from the opponent's hand.

## Sacrificing Permanents
Airship requires a sacrifice every turn to trigger. <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> is the easiest way to do this because it gives you a token every turn. When you do not have Pursuit, it becomes important to pace your sacrifices and plan ahead for how you will trigger Airship on the next turn. Map tokens require creatures to use, so they can be unreliable if your creatures get removed. If you expect to lose your board, it is often better to use Maps earlier rather than risk having no way to sacrifice them. Sometimes you should also hold <CardName>Fabled Passage</CardName> so you can use it on the turn you need the trigger.

<CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> also cares about how many permanents you sacrifice in a single turn. It grants lifelink if you sacrifice three or more, which is extremely powerful. Because of this, you should think about how many permanents you want to sacrifice each turn and sometimes save something for the next turn to reach the threshold.

Sacrificing usually costs mana, but there are two easy ways to hit the three sacrifice threshold for free. <CardName>Umbral Collar Zealot</CardName> gives you a free sacrifice outlet, and <CardName>Beseech The Mirror</CardName> lets you tutor Beseech multiple times while bargaining each copy, which can stack up to 4 sacrifices.

## Conclusion

I think this deck has potential to be a player in the meta, although it still requires tuning. I'll definitely be working on the list more and keeping it up to date.

If you’re looking for a midrange strategy with multiple dimensions, a strong engine, and one of the coolest inevitability plans Standard has seen in a long time, Golgari Airship is definitely worth picking up.
