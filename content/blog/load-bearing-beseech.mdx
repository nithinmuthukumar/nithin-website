## Introduction
I recently watched an Aspiringspike [video](https://youtu.be/_jYzNd7ifTc?si=kwLgE11OlJTEJZWf) where he played Elves in Modern. He briefly compared <CardName>Selfless Safewright</CardName> to <CardName>Selfless Spirit</CardName>, noting that while they serve the same purpose, Safewright takes pressure off <CardName>Chord of Calling</CardName> because it can be convoked at instant speed. I hadn't thought of this concept explicitly before, but I immediately drew the parallel to <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> in Golgari Airship.

Why does taking pressure off a tutor matter? Tutors are powerful because of their flexibility, but that flexibility comes with tension. When you use a tutor on utility such as removal, protection, or a silver bullet, you are not using it to advance your own plan. That is a meaningful opportunity cost. Once the tutor is spent, so is the chance to convert it into direct progress toward your win condition. 

I have had many games where Beseech answered the immediate problem correctly, but left me without a clear way to close. It was still the correct decision, but the cost was real.

In Golgari Airship, the primary plan is to tutor for <CardName>Phoenix Fleet Airship</CardName>. Airship is also at its strongest when it is found through Beseech, which further incentivizes using the tutor proactively. At the same time, especially after sideboarding, the deck includes alternative tutor targets meant to provide the right answer at the right moment.

That dual role puts real pressure on Beseech. Using it correctly becomes critical, because every time you spend it on interaction, you are choosing not to advance your primary plan. Navigating that tension is a core part of piloting the deck well.

## Building the Toolbox

Is Golgari Airship a toolbox deck?

It can be. <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> can tutor for any card in the deck, which naturally encourages playing one-ofs in the mainboard and sideboard that are highly effective in specific situations. When you have access to a tutor, narrow cards become more appealing because you can find them exactly when they are needed.

The tradeoff is obvious. Those same cards are often weak natural draws. If they do not line up with the current game state, they can sit in hand and contribute very little.

My previous approach to building the sideboard leaned into maximizing tutor value. This means narrower, higher ceiling effects that are at their best when found at the right moment. Cards like <CardName>Wear Down</CardName> and <CardName>Dauntless Scrapbot</CardName> are examples of this. These cards justify the mana cost when compared to their counterparts and feel impactful when found at the right moment, but that philosophy assumes Beseech is freely available for reactive use.

Since thinking about taking pressure off a tutor, I am more aware of how much responsibility <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> carries in the deck. This has pushed me towards valuing flexibility more highly in my card evaluation framework for the deck.

I am currently playing <CardName>Heritage Reclamation</CardName>
/<CardName>Pawpatch Formation</CardName> over <CardName>Wear Down</CardName>. Both cards offer significantly more flexibility, allowing them to remain relevant across a wider range of matchups. They also provide value even when their primary effect is not needed, which makes them much less clunky as natural draws.

## The Real Toolbox Deck

Standard does have a toolbox deck in 5 Color Cub. The deck plays 8 tutors and <CardName>Nature's Rhythm</CardName> even has Harmonize. With that many, it makes the opportunity cost on getting any silver bullet much lower.

Golgari Airship does not have that same luxury, except in the cases where you have multiple <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName>s in hand. When that happens, it becomes much safer to deviate. You can afford to spend one on a side option because the proactive line is still available.

In the Cub matchup, for example, I am comfortable tutoring for <CardName>Phoenix Fleet Airship</CardName> if I have a second Beseech in hand that can later fetch <CardName>Day of Judgement</CardName>. Without that backup, I am far more hesitant and will often hold the Beseech instead. <CardName>Day of Judgement</CardName> is an important safety valve in the matchup, and can very much be game-winning.

## Conclusion

<CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> is the most powerful card in the deck, but it is also the most stressed. Its flexibility is what makes Golgari Airship so consistent, and that naturally makes building as a toolbox appealing. The ability to find the exact card you need is real and often game winning.

What has changed is not whether flexibility is powerful, but how I evaluate cards in the context of this deck. I used to judge sideboard slots primarily by how strong they were when tutored for. If a card felt high impact when found off <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName>, that was often enough justification to include it. The ceiling mattered most.

Now my evaluation starts from a different place. I ask how the deck functions when Beseech is not available, or when it needs to be used proactively. Instead of asking “How strong is this when I tutor for it?”, I ask “How good is this card as a draw?” and “How much additional burden does this put on Beseech?”

Specific silver bullets still have their place. There are matchups where a single card dramatically shifts the game, and those effects are worth preserving. The difference is that I no longer want the deck to revolve around maximizing those moments. Beseech should enhance those spots when they come up, not be required to make the deck function in the first place.
