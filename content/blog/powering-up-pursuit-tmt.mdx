## Introduction

<CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> is one of the most powerful engines in Standard. It provides both card advantage and counters, but in practice it can be difficult to fully leverage. The primary bottleneck has always been converting Clue tokens into meaningful advantage quickly enough. Because of this, in Standard it's ideal to pair <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> with a <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> package as all the extra mana can be converted into card advantage.

With the release of the TMT set, we gain access to <CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName>, a card that directly addresses this weakness. Mutagen Man not only produces its own artifact tokens, but also reduces the cost of sacrificing artifact tokens by 1. That combination has the potential to significantly increase the ceiling of Pursuit-based strategies.

Golgari Airship has been my preferred shell for <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> in the current metagame. I have a [68% winrate (57-27)](https://mtga.untapped.gg/profile/12190cdd-70c3-4cf2-939e-e060140cc533/XWLADHLAOJASBEA6HGPYJE2WNI/deck/5b53e561-70e3-4f99-85ab-80a87a5e9ee5?gameType=constructed&constructedType=ranked&constructedFormat=standard) with the [latest iteration](https://moxfield.com/decks/yF298oBNK0-MGUNeDa_vlQ), and the deck is well positioned to capitalize on new tools from TMT. In this article, I'll evaluate the most relevant additions, explore how they fit into Golgari Airship, and outline another potential direction for the archetype.

## Evaluating Mutagen Man

<CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName> is the most impactful new addition for the Pursuit archetype.

It is a scaling threat that:
- Creates X Mutagen tokens
- Reduces the cost of sacrificing artifact tokens by 1
- Has trample and starts as a 2/3

On its own, Mutagen Man allows you to sacrifice the Mutagen tokens it creates for free. It scales well with the mana you put into it so at it's floor, the card is perfectly serviceable. It's also a 2-for-1 since you can invest the tokens into another creature or leave them behind for other purposes.

### Downsides

There are two meaningful constraints:
1. **Legendary** – Drawing multiples can be awkward, making 4 copies questionable.
2. **Double Green** – The mana cost is demanding, especially in builds that support <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName>.

Even though he is legendary, Mutagen Man is a must-answer threat in most matchups due to the trample, and even redundant copies can represent additional token bursts. The ceiling is high enough that 2–3 copies feel correct in most builds, with four being defensible in more streamlined shells.


### Context: Golgari Airship

<CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName> and <CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName> synergize extremely well. The cost reduction can compound with <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> ramp to utilize Pursuit to it's maximum potential. Each Mutagen token effectively represents two +1/+1 counters, allowing you to cross lifelink thresholds quickly and generate sudden bursts of pressure.

If you already have a creature on board, <CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName> can immediately turn it into a huge life swing. This gives the archetype a much stronger aggressive angle, which is something it typically only achieves on its best draws. That shift could be especially relevant against slower strategies like Landfall or Elementals, which make up a meaningful portion of the current metagame.

Mutagen Man also pairs naturally with the <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> ramp package. It functions as an additional mana sink in games where you generate excess resources without a payoff. There is real modality here: you can deploy it for a modest X when you already have Clues to sacrifice, or invest heavily to create a large number of mutagen tokens.

The primary concern is the double green mana cost. In Golgari Airship, the mana base is already stretched, and accommodating GG introduces some tension. This likely requires adjustments — trimming utility lands or increasing dual density with options like <CardName>Starting Town</CardName>. That said, <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> is a large source of green, and the issue appears manageable.

### Comparing Alternatives

Mutagen Man is fairly unique, but it plays a similar role to <CardName>Sentinel of the Nameless City</CardName> as a creature token generator.

Sentinel is already a core part of Golgari Airship, which sets a strong precedent for Mutagen Man being viable. It’s a repeated source of tokens that also does a good job applying pressure while holding the ground defensively. That combination of board presence and steady value is a big part of why it’s been so reliable.

The big difference with Mutagen Man is the cost reduction and mana sink it provides. That flexibility adds a layer of explosiveness the deck doesn’t always have. It gives you more ways to use your mana efficiently and can effectively fill gaps in the curve, especially in games where you’re generating excess resources.

Although I’m framing this as a comparison, the cards aren’t mutually exclusive. Map tokens only costing one already pairs naturally with Mutagen Man’s reduction, and the two can work together in meaningful ways. My starting point would likely be a split, keeping Sentinel’s consistency while adding Mutagen Man’s ceiling.

<Aside>

#### Aside: Map vs Mutagen Tokens

This comparison isn't central to evaluating Mutagen Man versus Sentinel, but it is interesting.

Map tokens and Mutagen tokens are structurally similar. They both cost one to activate and can result in +1/+1 counters. The key difference is that Map tokens introduce variance, while Mutagen tokens are deterministic. Breaking it down into cases makes the comparison straightforward.

#### Case 1: Map Reveals a Creature

In this case, the Map effectively functions like a Mutagen token by putting a +1/+1 counter on the creature. On top of that, you gain information and card selection from the reveal, which is meaningful upside. In this scenario, the Map token is strictly better.

#### Case 2: Map Reveals a Land

The benefit of this outcome is contextual. If you need to hit a land drop, revealing a land can be extremely important. If you're trying to push damage or survive combat and need the extra counter, missing on the Map can be a drawback. The value depends entirely on the game state.

</Aside>

### Meta Considerations

<CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName> lines up well against a lot of the interaction currently seeing play. Because it is an X spell, it is very easy to play around <CardName>Spell Snare</CardName>. Since the mana value includes X, you can scale it out of range by simply investing more than 0 mana.

Its three toughness is also relevant. It survives sweepers and cheap damage-based interaction such as <CardName>Pyroclasm</CardName> and <CardName>Firebending Lesson</CardName>, which gives it a solid floor and makes it easier to start stacking counters safely.

There is, however, a vulnerability window. Because the Mutagen tokens can only be activated at sorcery speed, the opponent has an opportunity to remove Mutagen Man before it can grow out of range. Red removal like <CardName>Sear</CardName> or <CardName>Lightning Helix</CardName> can take advantage of this, while also taking out a token.

## Other Cards

After Mutagen Man, the rest of the set offers small upgrades, rather than a core change. These are the most relevant.

### The Ooze

<CardName>The Ooze</CardName> is a really interesting card that has so much attached to it. It has a <CardName>The Ozolith</CardName> style effect that creates mutagen tokens, allowing you to preserve your counter investments. It also just makes mutagen tokens being an engine in it's own right.

The graveyard hate is additional upside rather than the main draw. It’s relevant in a number of matchups and can swing certain games, but the synergy with counters and tokens is what makes it appealing.

#### Meta Considerations

In the sideboard, it’s worth comparing this to other graveyard hate options, since that would be its primary role outside of synergy. I’m not particularly high on it as a dedicated hate piece. It’s very similar to <CardName>Ghost Vacuum</CardName> in function and shares many of the same strengths and weaknesses. Exiling a single card per turn cycle can simply be too slow in matchups like Spellementals or Kavaero.

It also gets hit by <CardName>Wistfulness</CardName>, which is a significant drawback and one of the main reasons I currently prefer <CardName>Keen-Eyed Curator</CardName> in that slot. That said, this effect does have upside in the Landfall matchup, where exiling an earthbent land and preventing it from returning can be meaningful.

My current evaluation is that I’ll likely play one copy in the main deck and none in the sideboard. As a primary graveyard hate card, it’s not efficient enough. However, the additional synergy and incidental value it provides make it reasonable as a flexible main-deck inclusion.

### Leatherhead, Swamp Stalker

I’ve already been hearing a lot about how <CardName>Leatherhead, Swamp Stalker</CardName> is a “Lessons killer.” On rate alone it’s just very strong. A 5/4 with trample and hexproof is a real threat, especially in interaction heavy matchups.

It’s particularly interesting with Beseech because it costs four, which makes it an easy inclusion as a tutor target. It also pairs well with <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName>, since hexproof lets you safely stack counters onto it without worrying about getting blown out by removal. In matchups where everything dies on sight, that’s a big deal.

I’ve explored the slot for an alternative target for <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> quite a bit and <CardName>Leatherhead, Swamp Stalker</CardName> is a strong contender. I can see this as a one-of in the main deck or as a sideboard option for interaction heavy decks.

### Tainted Treats

Just noting down <CardName>Tainted Treats</CardName> as a possible sideboard option, I don't think it fits into the current meta. The card is quite flexible and also provides a token, which is a meaningful plus.

### Technodrome

With the addition of <CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName>, I don’t think a passive artifact sacrifice outlet is necessary in Golgari. Mutagen Man already provides cost reduction and scaling pressure, which covers most of what <CardName>Technodrome</CardName> provides.

This card may be better suited to non-green Pursuit shells that lack access to Mutagen Man. In those builds, having a dedicated artifact sacrifice engine could be much more important, and in that context it becomes a very reasonable option.

## New Brew: Golgari Counters

<DecklistCard url="https://moxfield.com/decks/gfdYIrNGcUGI0lplDMIdDw">
  ![Golgari Counters TMT](/deckpics/golgari-pursuit-tmt.png)
</DecklistCard>

Here's a brew I put together that completely avoids <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> and goes much more all-in on counter synergies. It takes advantage of <CardName>Michelangelo, Weirdness to 11</CardName> and <CardName>Mikey & Leo, Chaos & Order</CardName> as two other TMT cards that have strong counter synergies.

The deck avoids the mana constraints imposed by <CardName>Beseech the Mirror</CardName> and is able to take advantage of GG cards comfortably. It's also acceptable to play a lower land count since the deck doesn't need to curve to 4.

I’ve tried to build this kind of shell before TMT, but it always felt like the 2 mana creatures just weren't ideal. TMT changes that with the new two-drops.

The deck still runs a <CardName>Badgermole Cub</CardName> package to get off the ground, but instead of tutoring, it leans into synergy and pressure. There are plenty of mana sinks between <CardName>Obsessive Pursuit</CardName>, <CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName>, and <CardName>Innkeeper's Talent</CardName>, so excess resources can always be converted into board presence.

This version is very proactive. It can have very explosive starts, but it still has the ability to grind through longer games thanks to Pursuit. It definitely needs testing, but there’s real promise in this direction.

## Conclusion

At this point, all of this is theory. No testing has been done yet, and that’s going to matter a lot. On paper, the additions look powerful and the synergies are obvious, but until the decks are put through real matches it’s impossible to know how they actually line up against the field and the other decks that will emerge.

That said, I do think Golgari Airship is getting a meaningful boost from TMT, especially compared to the complete lack of playables from ECL. <CardName>Mutagen Man, Living Ooze</CardName> alone is a major upgrade. The Ooze adds flexibility, and Leatherhead gives the deck a legitimate tutorable threat that lines up well into interaction.

I’ll be putting in the reps over the coming weeks to see which direction actually holds up. If the early impressions translate into results, Airship could be entering its strongest iteration yet.
